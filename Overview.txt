To create the webpage, I followed the following steps:

Plan and outline: I first planned the structure and content of my webpage. I created an outline of the different sections I wanted to include and how they would be organized.

Write HTML: Once I had a clear plan, I began writing the HTML code. I started with the basic structure of the webpage, including the head and body sections. I then added the different sections of the webpage, including the navigation bar, side bar, filter bar, and content sections. I also added the necessary HTML tags to structure and style the content.

Add CSS: After writing the HTML, I added CSS to style the different sections of the webpage. I created separate CSS files for each section and linked them to my HTML code using the link tag in the head section.

Add icons and fonts: I used Ion Icons for the icons on my webpage. I included the necessary script tags in the head section to link the icons to my webpage. I also used Google Fonts to add custom fonts to my webpage. I included the necessary link tags in the head section to link the fonts to my webpage.

Test and debug: Finally, I tested my webpage on different devices and browsers to make sure it displayed correctly. 

Overall, creating this webpage required careful planning, attention to detail, and knowledge of HTML, CSS, and web design best practices.
